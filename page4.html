      <h3>How has it improved my computational thinking skills?</h3>

        <i
          >The foundation year computational thinking module has broadened my
          understanding of what it means to think <b>algorithmically</b>. Rather
          than just focusing on writing code or learning a programming language,
          which is what I had experienced in sixth form, my understanding of how
          problems can be solved and algorithm analysis improved significantly.
          <br /><br />My favourite part of computational thinking was
          route-finding using <b>graphs</b> to represent maps. Using
          <b>graphs</b> allowed finding all possible ways to reach one side of a
          map to another easier to visualise and saves a lot of time.</i

      <h3>How has it improved my computational thinking skills?</h3>
      <p>
        <i
          >The foundation year computational thinking module has not only
          developed my skills as a computer scientist but also drawn away from
          the code heavy focus of A-Level and more towards the theories that
          form their foundation. <br /><br />For example, I while I had
          previously gained knowledge surround <b>Big O-Notation</b> I had never
          run through an algorithm step-by-step to exactly understand where this
          notation came from and how it worked. <br /><br />
          My favourite part of this module was looking at <b>recursion</b> and
          understanding its inner workings. In particular I enjoyed the group
          workshop around this subject as whiile I found it tricky, it in turn
          was very rewarding for me.</i

      <h2>Albert Bradshaw's Reflection</h2>
      <h3>How has it improved my computational thinking skills?</h3>
      <p>
        <i
          >The foundation year computational thinking module has developed my
          ideas around computer science as whole alongside developing my skills
          in working as a team. I have learnt how to better collaborate with my
          coursemates and deliver my ideas in a more concise way.<br /><br />
          In particular, I believe I gained skills on how to read algorithms and
          understand their flow to a higher degree. I think this was
          particularly developed by the <b>workshop</b> sessions where I
          challenged my groups ideas and learnt new information.<br /><br />
          My favourite part of the computational thinking module was learning
          about the logic surrounding <b>path-finding algorithms</b> and their
          logical implications. I have an interest in videogames and so it was
          interesting to learn about this at the lowest level.</i

      <h1> What skills are developed in Computational Thinking? </h1>
          <p> The transition from A-Level to the foundation year course significantly enhances <b>problem-solving techniques and computational reasoning</b>. While A-Level focused on fundamental programming constructs and algorithms, the foundation course refines these skills by emphasizing structured problem decomposition and the ability to analyze computational complexity. Key areas of development include: </p>
      <ol>
          <li> <b>Decomposition:</b> Breaking down complex problems into ordered steps, making them easier to solve. </li>
          <li> <b>Abstraction & Generalization:</b> Identifying patterns in problems and applying solutions to a broad range of scenarios. </li>
          <li> <b>Computational Complexity:</b> Understanding the efficiency of algorithms and the limits of computation. </li>
          <li> <b>Collaboration & Practical Application:</b> Engaging in group-based problem-solving exercises and online discussions, mirroring real-world computing environments, where collabarative work is crucial. </li>
          <li> By building on these core principles, the foundation year helps bridge the gap between academic study and practical computing, preparing students for more advanced university-level coursework. </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>What is Decomposition?</h1>
      <p>Decomposition is the process of <b>breaking down larger problems</b> into smaller tasks.<br>IT divides data into smaller components for easier <b>analysis and understanding</b>. In Computer Science, this can be used when we design our Algorithms and allows us to tackle more <b>difficult</b> problems.</p>

    <div class="topics-boxes">
      <h1>What is Abstraction?</h1>
      <p>Abstraction is the process of <b>hiding certain details</b> around a project to only retain and focus on the <b>essential</b> parts of a system.<br>This is useful as when designing our solutions we can <b>focus</b> on its <b>core aspects</b> to create the best foundations.<br>Furthermore, it allows programmers to work at high levels of <b>complexity</b> without needing to know very low-level operations and skills.</p>

    <div class="topics-boxes">
      <h1>What is Complexity?</h1>
      <p>Computational complexity is the study of the relationship between <b>input size</b> and the <b>resources</b> needed to solve a problem with this data. <br>This allows us to <b>effectively</b> plan how much <b>storage or time</b> will be used in our algorithms.<br>We then study these relationships more deeply and can look at the relationships in the <b>best</b>, <b>worst</b> and <b>average</b> case.</p>

    <div class="topics-boxes">
      <h1>Team Working Development</h1>
      <p>Not only do we focus on academic skills learnt in this module, their is also a partiular focus on our <b>inter-personal</b> and <b>team-working</b> skills. <br> Much of Computational Thinking requires strong team working skills which will be developed greatly through this unit. <br>This will help prepare you with the skillsfor <b>working inside coding</b> and <b>tech teams!</b></p>

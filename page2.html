        <p> <h3> What are the main changes from sixth form to computational thinking at university? </h3> </p>
        <p> In the transition from A-Level Computer Science to the foundation year, several key differences can be observed. The foundation course places a stronger emphasis on <b>computational thinking</b>, focusing on how problems are structured and solved in a more formalized way. <br><br>Unlike A-Levels, where programming and theoretical knowledge are assessed separately, this course integrates both aspects, requiring students to apply <b>problem-solving techniques in practical scenarios</b>.
            <br><br>Additionally, the foundation course introduces a greater emphasis on <b>group work and collaboration</b>. While A-Level projects were often individual efforts, the foundation course involves workshops and practical assignments where <b>teamwork is a key component</b>. This helps students develop communication and collaboration skills that are essential in the industry.
            <br><br>One of the key <b>differences</b> lies in more group and collabarative involvement. For most people in their previous education, any computer science project was individual and marked individually. In this unit, is is highly likely you that you with groups of people you may not know. The <b>coursework</b> in the unit requires to work in these groups and arrange your own meetings. </p>
